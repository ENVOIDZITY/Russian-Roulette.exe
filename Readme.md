Hi, this is an russian roulette malware

I do not take any responsability for damages done with this malware please use a virtual machine
This malware is written in python

How to use:

Download the file
Run it in command prompt

How it works:

If you feel lucky you can run the file
It then generates a number between 1 and 6
If it lands on 6 it will delete your system32 directory
If it lands on 1-5 nothing will happen and the malware will stop

Anyone can borrow this source code
